sort recusive == n log n, where "log n" because each loop is a halfing
* where log n == the hight of the tree
* and n == the with or number of elements in the base arr/list

loop
    loop
is N^nested leveles, n^2 in this case


def foo(n)
    return foo(n+1) + foo(n+2)

O is O(2^n)

where 2 = 1 foo + 1 foo

space complexxity
0(1)
print
***UNLESS RECUSION which makes it O(n) because of the statck caused by recurion

because only prints one at a time



BINARY TREE:
*Just to reconfirm please.... dft == LIFO & bft == FIFO.  Correct?
