ok so we can just use sass on the side and it will auto, cool (edited)

Russ Hacker  3 days ago
or we need to run that node-sass she just did?

You need to install sass like I did but then React will handle compiling it all.

um so I note it can you paste that command here so I can try and mess with that to this afternoon?

Christina Gorton:lambdared:  3 days ago
npm install node-sass

and then manually make CSS === SCSS and change the include lines for those files... (edited)
