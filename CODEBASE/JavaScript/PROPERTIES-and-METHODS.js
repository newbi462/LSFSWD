/*PROPERTIES*/
const school = 'Lambda';

/*Properties allow us to access data from a data type.
There are many different properties on every data type that will give you a bit of information about that specific object.
One we will look at here is the length property of a string.
It will give us the length of the string, as in how many characters are in the string (spaces count).*/

/*METHODS*/
const num = 42;
num.toString(); //"42"
/*Methods allow us to manipulate a data type.
Methods are different from properties in that they need to have parentheses on the end.
The method we will look at here is the toString method.
It will convert a Number or Boolean to a string.*/
