/*DATA TYPES*/
/*STRINGS*/
const dog = 'fido';
const dog = "fido";
/*Strings are blocks of text.
They will always be defined with quotation marks around them, either single or double.
Any text with quotes around it is a string.*/

/*string template literals*/
`${cb[i].title} was made by ${cb[i].manufacturer} in ${cb[i].year}`
// NOTE the use of ``(tildy) not the ''(quotse single or duble)

/*NUMBERS*/
const answer = 42;
const negative = -13;
/*Numbers are just that, numbers.
Numbers do NOT have quotes around them.
They can be negative as well.
JavaScript does have a limitation on the size of a number (+/- 9007199254740991), but only very rarely will that limitation come up.*/

/*BOOLEANS*/
const iLoveJavascript = true;
/*Booleans come from low-level computer science.
It is a concept that powers binary code and the very core of computers.
You may have seen binary code in the past (e.g., 0001 0110â€¦).
That is Boolean logic.
It essentially means you have two choices, on or off, 0 or 1, true or false.
In JavaScript, we use Booleans to mean true or false.
This may seem simple at first but can get complicated later on.*/
