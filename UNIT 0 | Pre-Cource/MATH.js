/*MATH WITH JS*/
/*BASIC MATH*/
1 + 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 - 2 = 0
2 / 2 = 1
/*One of the first jobs a computer had was to compute numbers.
In JavaScript, we have built-in math operators that work exactly as they do on your calculator.*/

/*FIND THE REMINDOR*/
21 % 5 = 1;
21 % 6 = 3;
21 % 7 = 0;
/*Something you may not have seen before is the Modulo (%).
This math operator will divide the two numbers and return the remainder.*/

/*EXPONET*/
Math.pow(2,2) = 4;
Math.pow(3,2) = 9;
Math.pow(3,3) = 27;
/*We can use the pow method on Math to return a number risen to an exponent.
It will take two numbers.*/

/*ROUND*/
Math.round(6.5) = 7;
Math.round(6.45) = 6;
Math.floor(6.999) = 6;
Math.ceil(6.0001) = 7;
/*Math also has methods that will round numbers for us.
.round will round a number to the nearest whole number.
.floor will always round a number down to the nearest whole number.
.ceil will always round up to the nearest whole number.*/
